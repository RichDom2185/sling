# Sling protocol

A "client" is a host running some sort of programming environment e.g. the Source Academy frontend, which is a Source programming environment.

A "device" is a host running an SVML interpreter (e.g. Sinter). A device shall have a "device ID".

Clients and devices communicate using messages over MQTT, facilitated by an MQTT broker.

Messages have a type. Messages of a given type are published on the MQTT topic `<device ID>/<message type>`, which makes it easy to restrict clients to only devices they are authorised to access, and devices to only send and receive messages on their specific topics.

There should only be one device listening on a particular device ID.

All messages should be published with MQTT QoS of at least 1. (2 is preferred, however AWS IoT does not support MQTT QoS 2.) Subscriptions should also be made with QoS of at least 1.

## Data types

All values are represented in little-endian byte order. There is no padding between consecutive fields in a struct.

Data types are specified using Rust type names:

- `i32` is a 32-bit signed integer
- `u32` is a 32-bit unsigned integer
- `f32` is a 32-bit IEEE 754 binary floating point
- `str` is a `u32` string length excluding null-terminator, followed by a UTF-8 null-terminated string
- `bool` is a boolean, which is a `u8` representing `true` if nonzero, and `false` otherwise

## Message format

All messages have the following MQTT payload:

| Name                  | Type  |
| --------------------- | ----- |
| Message number        | `u32` |
| Type-specific payload | ...   |

### Message numbers

#### Client &rarr; Device

The message number for Client &rarr; Device messages should be a random nonce. Devices should use it to guard against duplicate deliveries of the same message.

#### Device &rarr; Client

The message number for Device &rarr; Client messages is a strictly increasing number starting from 0.

- Message ID 0 must be a Hello message.
- Message numbers should not be skipped, that is, consecutive messages should have consecutive message numbers.
  - This is to facilitate reconstructing `display` messages in the correct order.
- When the message number is 4 294 967 295 (2^32 minus 1), devices may wrap the number around to 0.

## Message types

### `run` (Client &rarr; Device)

Payload: compiled SVML program

Causes the device to run the given program, if it is not already running another program.

Upon receipt of the message, the device should publish a `status` message to update all connected clients.

### `stop` (Client &rarr; Device)

Payload: none

Causes the device to stop running any currently running program.

Upon receipt of the message, the device should publish a `status` message to update all connected clients.

### `ping` (Client &rarr; Device)

Payload: none

Causes the device to publish a `status` message with its current status.

### `hello` (Device &rarr; Client)

Payload: `u32` nonce

Sent when the device first comes online. This must be sent with a message ID of 0. When this is sent, clients should reset their receive message counters to 0. The nonce is used to guard against repeat deliveries of the same `hello` message.

### `status` (Device &rarr; Client)

#### Payload

| Name          | Type                                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Device status | `u16` (0 = idle, 1 = running, 2 = prompt) |

If the status is 2 (prompt), the status is followed by:

| Name          | Type  |
| ------------- | ----- |
| Prompt string | `str` |

### `display` (Device &rarr; Client), `input` (Client &rarr; Device)

`display` sends output from running program(s) back to clients.

Clients should buffer display messages until a Flush display message is received. When a Flush message is received, clients should sort the buffered display messages, reconstruct the display message, and then display it as a single display message as appropriate for the client's user interface.

The slightly awkward structure of this message is to reduce the amount of formatting and buffering that the device has to do, and offload that onto the client instead. For example, when printing an array, the device may send displays like this

- `"["`
- `1`
- `", "`
- `2`
- `"]"`

to avoid having to stringify numbers on the device, which may have limited memory and processing power.

#### Payload

| Name                 | Type                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Display message type | `u16`                           |
| Sub-payload          | Depends on display message type |

Payload for all display message types, except Flush:

| Name              | Type    |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| Message data type | `u16`   |
| Message data      | Various |

Payload for Flush:

| Name                    | Type  |
| ----------------------- | ----- |
| Starting message number | `u32` |

#### Display message type

For `display`:

| Type            | Value |
| --------------- | ----- |
| Standard output | 0     |
| Standard error  | 1     |
| Program result  | 2     |
| Flush           | 100   |

For standard output, standard error, and program result, the high byte can be set to 1 to indicate a self-flush (i.e. this display message consists of only the part in the current message).

For `input`:

| Type            | Value |
| --------------- | ----- |
| Prompt response | 4     |

#### Message data

These correspond to `sinter_type_t` in Sinter.

| Type      | Type value | Payload                                                      |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Null      | 2          | None                                                         |

| Float     | 5          | `f32`                                                        |
| String    | 6          | `str`                                                        |
| Array     | 7          | `str` Device implementation-defined stringification of array |
| Function  | 8          | None                                                         |
